# Editorial Contrast

## Intent
Create an editorial, print-inspired interface with bold typographic hierarchy, high contrast, and disciplined whitespace. Keep composition clean but not sterile.

## Do
- Use strong heading scale with compact body text rhythm.
- Keep neutral base colors and one assertive accent color.
- Use clear section framing and deliberate vertical spacing.
- Prefer thin borders and minimal shadows.

## Avoid
- Avoid glossy gradients and heavy glassmorphism.
- Avoid oversized rounded corners everywhere.
- Avoid playful illustration style unless requested.

## Tokens
- Color: deep ink foreground, paper-like background, one saturated accent.
- Type: display serif + practical sans pairing.
- Space: 4/8px rhythm with larger section breaks.
- Radius: low radius (0-8px).
- Depth: mostly flat, with selective elevation.
- Motion: subtle reveal and hover transitions only.

## Component Notes
- Hero: headline-led, low visual clutter.
- Navigation: compact top bar with clear text affordances.
- Buttons: text-first or outline styles.
- Cards: framed blocks with disciplined spacing.
- Forms: high-contrast inputs with visible labels.
- Footer: dense but readable information grouping.

## Motion Notes
- Keep durations short (120-220ms).
- Use fade/translate micro-motions for entry.

## Responsive Notes
- Collapse multi-column editorial grids into stacked sections on mobile.
- Preserve typographic hierarchy by reducing scale proportionally.
